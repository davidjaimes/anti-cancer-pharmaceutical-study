### Observation 1

Regarding tumor volume over time, Capomulin is the only drug (out of four) that has a positive reponse. While Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo all experience tumor growth, Capomulin is the only one that reduces tumor volume over time.

### Observation 2

All four drugs have a positive slope change when we look at Metastic Site Spreads over time. However, Capomulin has the smaller slope and leads to smaller rate of spread at these sites.

### Observation 3

Capomulin has the highest survival rates of all four drugs. This is an understandable and expected effect from a drug with losses in cancer growth and smaller rates of spreading.
